-- Hey there! welcome back, in this post i want to shre the next thing i learn and creta  which is a UI Library using react, tailiwnd css and storybokk

By the way the reason I mentioned 'learn and create' is because the result i want for this weekly projecv is to get new knowledege in software dev, hope this will help me and  you too in real world

Let's dive into the project, Storybook is a free open-source projec thats allow you documenting your components, so we can reuse and automatically run visual tests to catch any bugs early on.

In other words, Storybook is a development environment tool that displays the UI components.

As you can see I've already create several compoennet such ase input, text, button and more of course the style menyesuaikan dengan projek yang saya butuhkan.

But that's not all. I've taken it a step further by creating two practical examples: a login form and a collection of cards, demonstrating how various components can seamlessly come together.

To provide you with more insights, I've included some source information and, of course, the source code in my caption. And with that, I'd like to thank you for watching.

Your support means the world to me.
